4. cmd should now read "(django-env) C:\django>", this means you are now in your virtual environemnt
5. to start localhost change directory to "django_project"
6. type "python manage.py runserver"
7. now you can open your web browser and go to "localhost:8000" to see the default page
8. I use Pycharm to modify my html/python files but you can use notepadd++ or whatever text editor you want.
